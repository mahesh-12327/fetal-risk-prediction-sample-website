In this research work, analyze the automatic prediction of fetal heart rate disease prediction from UCI fetal data set to improve the overall disease prediction accuracy. During the fetal heart rate data recognition process, fetal data is collected from patient using by optimized machine learning approaches. According to the discussions, fetal heart rate disease is predicted with the help of Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance feature selection based various classifier algorithms(Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM ,Navies bayes) and Principle component analysis feature selection based various classifier algorithms(Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Navies bayes, MLP).This examines the fetal risk prediction using PCA feature selection algorithm based on SVM classifier got the accuracy of 99% and performance metrics precision(98.3%),sensitivity(97.3%), F-score(98%).
