  	<h3>Objective</h3>
	<p>Improved feature selection methodology for fetal risk data collection defining important features. To create an algorithm for selecting an expert function for classifying fetal risk with full precision. Using machine learning techniques to design an optimal system for finding the most important and least redundant features.To know more about fetal risk visit <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29898442/">ncbi website</a></p><br><br>

	<h3>Motivation</h3>
	<p>About 25 babies out of 1000 births are affected by fetal asphyxia associated with metabolic acidosis Children's death in the first month of life is a significant contributor to underfive mortality. Intrapartum complications are one of the principal causes of perinatal mortality. Fetal cardiotocography (CTGs) can be used as a screening device to detect high-risk women during childbirth. Machine learning plays an important part in Fetal risk prediction. Machine Learning's goal is to understand the data structure and fit the data into a model. Feature Selection is one of Machine Learning's core concepts that impacts the model 's efficiency.</p>

	<h3>Background</h3>
	<p>Around 795 women die from preventable causes of death Pregnancy and childbirth, 98 percent of which are infantile Developing pays. Maternal deaths widespread A 845 per cent decrease after 1990, The ratio of global maternal mortality (no of deaths per 100090 Live birth) dropped by just 2,450 years per annum in 1989. And by 2015 Some gynaecologists say any t he trimester is about 98 days, which add to the a bout 41 weeks pregnant. About 21 million people Every year, ill health is endured worldwide by Pregnant. Pregnant. In 1990, the impact was about 376,000 women who died of complication in pregnancy, which fell to 293,000 in 2013. Of those 288,000 people died during the childbirth process and most of the deaths where settings could have been avoided in low facilities and most of them. Those who suffered from complications when they were giving birth or performing the operation. Before, during and after childbirth a skilled practitioner's care will rescue the lives of pregnant women and newborn babies. Most 	of the maternal deaths,  the strategies to prevent or treat complication, are escapable.</p>

        <p><div class="fetalheading"><b>Fetal heart monitoring</b></div><br>Cardiac Fetal control monitors the heart rhythm (fetus) of your infant. This helps the primary care professional to see how well the infant is. In the latter stages of pregnancy, the primary care provider will do a fetal heart rhythm check. The natural heart rate of fetuses varies from 110 to 155 bpm. This may be anywhere 5-24 beats per minute. The fetal heart rate varies  the baby responds to uterine condition. 
	An erratic fetal heart rate means the baby doesn't get enough oxygen or any other problem.<br><br>
        <div class="types">
	<b>A.External fetal heart monitoring</b><br>We use a system to hear the baby's heartbeat via patient abdomen and monitor it. An ultrasonic Doppler-system is one type of monitor. It's also used at prenatal appointments to monitor the baby's heart rate. It is also used to monitor fetal heart rate during pregnancy. During gestation and delivery, the physician can alsomonitor the baby's heart rate daily. 
	Your abdomen is fastened to the ultrasonic (transducer) probe to do so. It brings the sound of your baby's heart inside a computer. Your baby's heart rhythm and pattern is projected on a monitor,and written on paper.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
        </div>
        <div class="types">
	<b>B.Internal fetal heart monitoring</b><br>We place a wire (electrode) which is placed on the infant's scalp. From the baby the wire travels through the cervix. The computer binds. This approach provides stronger readings, as it does not influence such aspects as movement. But this can be done by removing and opening the cervix (amniotic sac) from the fluid-filled membrane that surrounds the baby during pregnancy. The provider can use internal checking if the external checking does not provide a good reading. And your doctor can use this device during pregnancy, to take a closer look at your infant. 
	<br>During delivery the health care provider must monitor the baby's uterine contraction and heart rate. The doctor will note how often you feel contractions & how long one lasts. As both heart rate and contraction are concurrently recorded as fetals, these results can be viewed and compared. 
	<br>During internal fetal heart monitoring, doctor can test the pressure inside the uterus. Doctor would then insert a tube across the cervix and into the uterus to do so. The catheter should forward a reading of uterine pressure to a monitor. <br>

	<b>Need of fetal heart monitoring</b><br>Monitoring of the fetal heart rate is useful when a woman has a high-risk pregnancy. If patient has diabetes or a high bp, the kid is at high risk. It is also high risk when the baby is not growing or progressing as it should. Monitoring of fetal heart rates may be used to test how early laboratory drugs impact the infant. These are medicines which help prevent the work from beginning too early. Many studies can also take advantage of fetal heart rate control including: <br><br>
	<b>A.Nonstress test :</b> This tracks fetal heart rate as the baby moves. <br>
	<b>B.Contraction stress test :</b> This tracks fetal heart rhythm between uterine contractions.Contractions are initiated using drugs or other 	methods. 
	<br><b>C.A biophysical profile :</b> It is a combination of nonstress and ultrasound tests. <br>
	<b>Risks of fetal monitoring</b><br>Radiation isn't required for the analysis. Typically the transducer does not inflict much pain. You might make the elastic belts that hold the transducers in place is  slightly uncomfortable. It can be adjusted 
	to match your needs.<br>You've got to lay still for other types of fetal heart rate control. You can need to lie in bed while you sleep. When electrodes are inserted into uterus, patients can feel some pain with internal checking. Internal risk control involves scalp inflammation & bruise, or other body part of the infant.<br> 
	<b>NOTE:</b><br>If you really are HIV-positive you do not have an independent control of the fetal heart rate. That's because you may be passing the infection on to your children. 
	You may be at certain odds depending on your particular health condition. Before the guidance, make sure to address any problems that you might have with your supplier.<br>Any factors may or may not render the effects of measuring fetal heart rate less reliable. Including: <br>-Baby position<br> 
	-Maternal obesity<br>
	-Too much fluid with amniotics (polyhydramnios)<br>

	<h3 style="text-align: center;font-size: 1.5em;">PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND GOALS</h3>
	The fetal risks include those associated with cyanosis itself, which are related to maternal hypoxia levels. When maternal cyanosis increases, the damage to fetal development is more pronounced, and babies are likely to have a low birth weight and be premature. Spontaneous abortion is more common in the first trimester, with increased maternal hypoxia. Retrospectively, Presbitero and colleagues analyzed the outcomes of 96 births in 44 females with cyanotic CHD. There were 41 live births (43 percent), 15 were premature at 26 to 37 weeks gestation, and only 26 (27 percent of all pregnancies) were term deliveries. At 6 weeks to 5 months there were 49 spontaneous pregnancies, and at 26 to 6 stillbirths thirty eight weeks gestation. Both the level of maternal hemoglobin and the saturation of arterial oxygen showed a close connection to the likelihood of a live birth.<br><b>
        It is accomplished in four steps:</b><br>
	1)Analyze the collection of data to assess the essence of the problem.<br>
	2) Identify critical features. <br>
	3)Extract those essential features and other features that are recommended.<br>
	4) Formulate a process for making the predictions and using the apps.<br>
